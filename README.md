# Lunky Helper

A simple program to keep track of Hou Yi's Bow as well as orbs in the Cosmic Ocean.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Joy2Key

## Intallation

After installing Python 3, run the following commands
```
pip install pyWinhook
pip install pygame
```

## Running

1. PyWinhook does not support controllers, so you will have to use Joy2Key. 
    - The default key for the bow is "Right"
    - The default key for orbs is "Left"
    - Personally I like to bind orbs to L1 and bow to L2 or L3
1. Use Python to execute `main.py'. Open a command prompt and execute the following:

```
"Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe" "Path where your downloaded main.py"

EG

B:\Projects\lunky_helper\venv\Scripts\python.exe B:\Projects\lunky_helper\main.py
```

You may have to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program for the images to load correctly.
